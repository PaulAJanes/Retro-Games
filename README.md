Pixelwerke8 is a lightweight 8-bit video game engine designed to run on a PIC18F16Q41 microcontroller.
Sprites populate a Tile-based grid, and the engine provides addressed movement and collision detection. The 1-bit renderer, by default, will use black and white as the two colors, but that can be configured to any two 16-bit colors.

Software:
MPLABX

Hardware:
PIC18F16Q41
ST7789 with SPI
LM386 to a 2.5W 8R speaker
5 buttons to C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7
